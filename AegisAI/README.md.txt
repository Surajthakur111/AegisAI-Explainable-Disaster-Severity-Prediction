AegisAI – Autonomous Disaster Intelligence Co-Pilot

1. Problem Statement
Current disaster response systems are reactive, fragmented, and heavily dependent on manual planning.
They lack real-time decision generation, equitable prioritization, and adaptive communication.

2. Vision
AegisAI is an AI-powered co-pilot that autonomously generates disaster response decisions,
resource allocation plans, and human-readable explanations in real time.

3. Core Capabilities
- Scenario Simulation
- Evacuation Decision Generation
- Resource Allocation with Equity Awareness
- Generative AI Communication
- Continuous Learning Loop

4. System World Model
The system understands the world using the following entities:
- Locations
- Roads
- Shelters
- Population Groups
- Resources
- Risks
- Constraints
- Decisions

5. Key Differentiator
AegisAI does not just predict disasters.
It generates decisions, explains them, and adapts continuously.

6. AI World Entities

#Location
Represents any geographic point (latitude, longitude).

#Road
Connects locations and may become unavailable during disasters.

#Shelter
A safe location with limited capacity and capabilities.

#Population Group
Represents people with different needs (elderly, children, disabled).

#Resource
Food, water, medical kits, power, or transport.

#Risk
A disaster event that changes the availability of roads, shelters, and resources.

#Decision
An AI-generated action such as evacuation, allocation, or alerting.
